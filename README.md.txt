#Writing a Data Scientist Blog Post

##Installations
I used Python3 and here are the libraries I used in my Jupyter Notebook:
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib.pyplot
4. Seaborn
5. Warnings

##Project Motivation
This project is part of Udacity's nanodegree Data Scientist and aims to apply the CRISP-DM process.

I used the dataset from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey, 2017 which can be found by accessing the following site: https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey

This project focuses on the responses obtained by developers from Latin America; segmenting it into 3 regions: Mexico, Central and South America. Seek answers to these questions:
1. Which location has the highest salary?
2. Which location has the highest salary growth?
3. Which location has the highest career satisfaction?

From the results obtained from the three previous questions, I have written a blog.

##File Descriptions
1. stack-overflow-developer-survey-2017 - The original data set containing the file in csv format containing the survey results
2. Code_SOD_survey_2017.ipynb - Notebook with complete analysis, answers to the questions, explanations and visualisations.

##How to interact with your project
The project is quite easy and intuitive, you only have to review and analyze the Jupyter Notebook file and observe the steps applied to obtain the results of the questions raised in the motivation of the project.
